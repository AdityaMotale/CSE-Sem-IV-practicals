      Imagine a plane, equal to the size of an ocean liner but in the sky. It
      was Hindenburg, the biggest and most elaborated airship ever built. At the
      time when commercial air travel seem impossible, the Hindenburg was iconic
      and the biggest. It cuts the travel time between two continents by nearly
      half.<br /><br />An airship is a lighter-then-air aircraft that can
      navigate through air under its own power. In early days, the Hydrogen gas
      was used as a lifting gas. But the problem with hydrogen is that it is a
      highly flammable gas, it can caught fire rapidly and can take down an
      entire ship in few minutes. <br />
      <br />Earlier that decade in 1930, world has faced many Airship disaster,
      many people have died. Because of it, many companies and countries
      shutting down their dream of luxury and commercial air travel.
      <br />
      <br />But unlike others, the German’s did not faced any accidents. That’s
      why the Hindenburg airship was the pride for Nazi regime, which started to
      gain huge popularity's back in Germany in those days. They said at the
      time that, “Yes it’s a highly flammable gas and can cause serious
      consequences. But if you take the right precautions you can control the
      risk”.
      <br />
      <br />Initially Hindenburg was planned to use Helium as a fuel instead of
      Hydrogen which is safer but little bit heavier then Hydrogen. But due to
      rising tensions of world war II, USA who had monopoly on the production of
      Helium at that time refused to sell it to the Germany, to avoid uses of
      helium in war. Because of it Hindenburg was modified to use Hydrogen.
      <br />
      <br />On 6 May 1997, when the airship was close to it’s destination, the
      tail was leaking the hydrogen fuel along with the emerging thunderstorm in
      the air and electrostatic charges from the recent thunderstorms, the
      Hindenburg was getting close to it’s destination. <br /><br />In the
      evening, while docking the ship with the tower, Hindenburg burst into
      flames, probably after the spark ignited in the fuel core due to
      electrostatic charges. Rapidly falling from 200 ft, it was burst in
      seconds. Even if some passengers and crew member’s jumped from the
      airship, in the end 13 passengers, 21 crewmen and 1 ground worker lost
      their lives and many were severely injured.<br />
      Radio announcer Herb Morrison, who came to Lakehurst to record a routine
      voice-over for an NBC newsreel, immortalized the Hindenburg disaster in a
      famous on-the-scene description in which he emotionally narrate the
      downfall of Hindenburg as,
      <br />

      <br />
      <br />Many conspiracies states that the airship was taken down by the
      enemy’s of the Nazi as it was only 2 year’s prior the world war II. Parent
      company of Hindenburg, the Zeppelin received many threatening letters
      about Hindenburg.
